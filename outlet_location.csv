With a digital-first mindset, while not ignoring traditional TV news, NJNN is spearheading the push to pushing out New Jersey content in various forms, including live streaming of reports and original shows, documentary-style podcasts and cinematic video shorts, behind-the-scenes sneak peeks and many more online-tailored programming. NJNN is a New Jersey news revolution, a digital evolution of an already established brand. KVNV-TV Channel 3, launched in the New York City market on Oct. 1, 2014 at 6 p.m., as MeTV with an episode of CHiPs. Two days later, on October 3, 2014, the call letters were changed to WJLP in honor of the company’s chairman Jules L. Plangere Jr. PMCM-TV LLC is the owner and operator of NJNN which is licensed to Middletown, New Jersey. Now, NJNN is able to serve not only the residents of New Jersey, who were being overlooked, but the entire New York market as well. It has a 7,000-watt transmitter at 4 Times Square in Manhattan.",,
