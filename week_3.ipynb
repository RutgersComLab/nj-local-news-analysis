      "NJ-11 race just 5th time in N.J. history where two women ran for Congress - New Jersey Globe New Jersey Globe Navigate X Homepage Congress David Wildstein 3 days ago Categories: CampaignsCongressHighlight NJ-11 race just 5th time in N.J. history where two women ran for Congress Sherrill, Becchi agree on this: both said nation would be better served in women outnumbered men in House, Senate Lillian Egolf, right, the 1962 Democratic candidate for Congress in a Union County district, with New Jersey First Lady (and future Congresswoman ) Helen S. Meyner, in a 1960 photo. (Photo: March of Dimes.) One takeaway from the race between Mikie Sherrill and Rosemary Becchi in New the 11th district: since women won the right to vote in 1920, this is just the 5th time both major parties have nominated a woman to run against each other for the U.S. House of Representatives. In the 650 congressional races in New Jersey since women won the right to vote 100 years ago, two major party women running for Congress happened just four times before Sherrill vs. Becchi. In 2014, Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing) and Republican Alitia Eck faced off in NJ-12. It was the only time in New Jersey where both parties nominated a woman to run for an open seat where no incumbent was seeking re-election. Rep. Marge Roukema (D-Ridgewood), who was the only women representing New Jersey for 20 of her 22 years in Congress, faced a Democratic woman opponent twice: she defeated Rose Brunetto, who had been involved in Demcoratic campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s, in 1984 with 71%; and won 65% against attorney Linda Mercurio in 2000. This first House race between two women came in 1962, when three-term Rep. Florence Dwyer (R-Elizabeth) faced a challenge from Lillian Egolf, the deputy Union County Register of Deeds and Mortgages. Egolf was the widow of former Rahway Mayor James Egolf. Dwyer won 60%-40%. New Jersey has only elected seven women to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and none to the United States Senate. The other three New Jersey congresswomen faced only male opponents: Mary T. Norton (D-Jersey City), who won a Hudson County House seat in 1925 and held it for sixteen years; Millicent Fenwick (R-Bernardsville); and Helen Meyner (D-Phillipsburg). In a debate on Sunday night, Sherrill and Becchi agreed on at least one thing: both said the nation would be better off if women outnumbered men in the House and in teh Senate. The possibility exists that New Jersey might increase the representation of women in their congressional delegation this year from two to three, if Democrat Amy Kennedy unseats Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis) this year. A recent Monmouth University poll has Kennedy running five points ahead of Van Drew. The current New Jersey delegation is 86% male. In total since 1920, New Jersey has elected 111 men and 7 women to Congress (94%-6%). The first woman to win a House seat from New Jersey was Norton, an ally of Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague. She was elected in 1924, the fifth woman to ever serve in Congress. Norton was an ally of Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague; she was the first Democratic State Committeewoman from Hudson County (elected in 1920), the first woman Freeholder in New Jersey (elected 1922), and the first woman to serve as New Jersey Democratic State Chair (elected 1933). She chaired four full House committees during her 26 years in Congress – the longest-serving Congresswoman in New Jersey history. After Norton retired – President Truman hired her as a “Womanpower Consultant” for the U.S. Labor Department’s Defense Manpower task force – New Jersey didn’t have a woman in the delegation until Dwyer, a Republican Assemblywoman from Elizabeth, defeated Rep. Harrison Williams in 1956. Dwyer served sixteen years in Congress before retiring in 1972. Two women were elected to Congress in 1974, back when New Jersey had fifteen districts: Meyner, a former First Lady of New Jersey (her husband was two-term Gov. Robert Meyner) who beat Rep. Joe Maraziti; and Fenwick, a former assemblywoman and state consumer affairs director who won Peter Frelinghuysen’s open seat. Meyner lost her bid for a third term in 1978 and Fenwick left to run for U.S. Senator in 1982. Roukema ousted Rep. Andy Maguire in 1982. Democrats nominated a woman for U.S. Senate in 1932, although it was in a special election to fill the remaining ten weeks of an unexpired term. The party nominated a man for the six-year term. New Jersey has never had a woman U.S. Senator, although the Republicans nominated women in 1982, 1984 and 1990. Republicans elected the first woman governor in 1993; Democrats nominated a woman to run for governor in 2013. New Jersey elected the first two women to the State Assembly in 1921 – about fifteen months after the 19th Amendment was ratified. It took 44 more years to elect a woman to the State Senate. The first woman Assembly Speaker was elected in 1965 – and not again until Sheila Oliver won the post in 2011. It took until 1957 for a black woman to win an Assembly seat, and it wasn’t until 1971 that a black woman was elected to the State Senate. Watson Coleman was the first black woman to be elected to Congress.

      "Richter gains local endorsements for House bid – New Jersey Globe New Jersey Globe Navigate X Homepage Congress David Wildstein 5 days ago Categories: CongressHighlight Richter gains local endorsements for House bid Former Hill International CEO seeking GOP nod to challenge Van Drew David Richter Click play for audio version of this story Former construction company CEO David Richter has been adding endorsements of local officials from New Jersey’s 2nd district in his bid to unseat freshman Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-Middle). Richter has picked up the backing of three Galloway Republican officials: Mayor Tony Coppola, Deputy Mayor Rich Clute and Councilman Tony DiPietro. Waterford Mayor Bill Richardson, Hammonton Councilman Joe Giralo and Somers Point Councilman James Toto have also endorsed Richter. Republicans held the seat for 24 years before Van Drew flipped it in 2018 following the retirement of Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-Ventnor). “David spent his career in the private sector growing a business, creating jobs and helping to expand our economy, unlike career politician Jeff Van Drew,” said Coppola. “He has established himself as one of the rising leaders of the Republican Party in South Jersey and I look forward to working with David as our next Congressman.” The Richter campaign will be hosting a “Silence the Speaker” event on Galloway on Friday while Nancy Pelosi is in Atlantic City to attend the New Jersey Democratic State Committee Conference. “Jeff Van Drew has completely failed South Jersey voters. He spent over a decade supporting the Democratic majority in the state legislature and making New Jersey one of the highest-taxed and most anti-business states in the country,” said Richter. “Now, after running as a conservative Democrat, Van Drew has voted in Washington with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez nearly 90% of the time.” Richter, the former Hill International CEO, is one of three Republicans already in the race to take on Van Drew. So far he’s facing former Atlantic County Young Republican Chairman Brian Fitzherbert and Robert Patterson, a controversial former Trump administration official. A fourth candidate, retired U.S. Navy captain Brian Glackin, is also exploring a House run. Glackin ran the Navy Appropriations Office on Capitol Hill before retiring.

Prosecutor: Toms River Teen Murdered Mom In Front Of Younger ... KNOW HIM? Suspect Wanted For Hitting Jersey Shore Uber Driver... comment 0 Read / Add Comments UPDATE: Authorities Thursday night identified two men captured by Bergen County prosecutor's detectives after a pursuit that topped out at 100 miles an hour ended when their car crashed off Route 80 in Hackensack. Deiby Valdez-Santos, a 27-year-old landscaper from East Harlem, and Jose E. Rodriguez-Castillo, a 25-year-old mechanic from Forest Hills, were both charged with drug possession, Bergen County Prosecutor Mark Musella said. Valdez-Santos, the driver, was also charged with eluding, Musella said. A prosecutor’s investigator had pulled over the pair's Honda sedan around 1 p.m. Wednesday on Route 80 and got out of his car when the driver suddenly hit the gas and sped off, Chief of Detectives Robert Anzilotti said. The detective called in the vehicle’s Connecticut license plate, which turned out to not match the car, the chief said. Another BCPO detective spotted the Honda a short time later -- this time on eastbound Route 80 -- and tried pulling it over, he said. But the driver kept going. The detective terminated the pursuit and pulled back out of concerns for civilian safety, Anzilotti said. A short distance ahead, the driver tried to make an abrupt turn from the far left lane to the Hudson Street exit in Hackensack. “He took it too fast,” the chief said. The car ended up going up on the grass media, hitting a wall and landing on its side. It also sideswiped another vehicle, but no one was injured, Anzilotti said. The first detective arrived and joined the pursuing investigator in taking the car’s two occupants into custody, he said. A judge ordered that Valdez-Santos remain held in the Bergen County Jail pending further court action. Rodriguez-Castillo, meanwhile, was released on his own recognizance pending a first appearance in Central Judicial Processing Court in Hackensack. New Jersey State Police investigated because a law enforcement agency was involved in a pursuit that ended in a motor vehicle accident. ****** ALSO SEE: A Little Ferry man thought he was about to hook up with a female prostitute who turned out to be one of three Bronx men who mugged him at a South Hackensack motel, authorities said. https://dailyvoice.com/new-jersey/hackensack/police-fire/phony-female-prostitute-pals-jump-little-ferry-customer-28-at-south-hackensack-motel/781644/ ****** Click here to sign up for Daily Voice's free daily emails and news alerts.

Killed were Audi Marquez Trinidad, 61, and daughters Kaitlyn, 20; Danna, 17; and 13-year-old twins Melissa and Allison. Mother Mary Rose Ballocanag, 54, who survived with serious injuries. spoke before Hubbard's sentencing, according to Delaware Online.

The truck hit a northbound Mercury Sable, spinning the sedan out of control, then continued south in the northbound lanes, where it was t-boned by the minivan, sending the pickup rolling onto the median, authorities said. Nearly $300,000 has been raised for the Trindads in a GoFundMe campaign. A splash pad at Teaneck's Votee Park was dedicated to the family.

Setnitzky, an avid bowler who is single, began working with the state Department of Transportation a year ago, records show. He previously drove a truck for J.B. Hunt, according to his online resume.

Police responded to Woodcrest Center Care One on River Road at about 9 a.m. on a report of fire on the second floor. Officers Darrell Marshall and William Reardon, along with staff, helped get a number of disabled patients out safely, Clancy said. The small fire, which started on a bed and spread to a wall, was extinguished by the facility's sprinkler system and contained to a single room, Clancy said. The room was empty when the fire started. A total of 22 people were treated for smoke inhalation, with 16 going to the hospital. Most of those who suffered smoke inhalation were staff who evacuated patients from the second floor, where the fire broke out. River Road was closed for two hours before the facility was reopened at around 11 a.m. No one will be displaced due to the fire, Clancy said. He went on to thank the agencies that responded, including ambulances from Hackensack, Holy Name and Englewood hospitals as well as from Teaneck, Bergenfield, Dumont and River Edge. “All departments involved worked really well together and we were able to avoid any serious injuries to the residents, employees and emergency personnel. The Care One staff and police officers that were first on scene really did a great job relocating disabled patients from the fire floor,\"\" Clancy said.

Jon Corzine and Rep. Bill Pascrell. Huge VBM turnout in Nutley: 33% Races in Orange, Belleville, Irvington and Newark By David Wildstein, May 12 2020 11:01 am Nutley takes its local politics seriously, and in today’s non-partisan race for all five town commissioner seats, it’s clear that voters are adapting to a municipal election conducted entirely through vote-by-mail ballots. According to local election officials, 2,242 of a possible 22,192 VBM ballots are already in – a 33% turnout so far — with more expected today and likely through Thursday. Twelve candidates are running for the five seats, including four incumbents: Mauro Tucci, Al Petracco, Thomas Evans and Mayor Joseph Scarpelli. By tradition, the top vote-getter becomes the mayor. The fifth incumbent, Steve Rogers, is not seeking re-election. Rogers, who sought the Republican nomination for governor in 2017, is following his own term-limits pledge. One of the candidates is John V. Kelly III, the grandson of the late Nutley mayor and assemblyman. Kelly finished sixth in 2016, 587 votes behind Rogers. Essex County races Turnout is less in three other Essex municipalities with elections today. In Orange, where Mayor Dwayne Warren is seeking re-election, 15% of VBM ballots have been returned. Turnout is also 15 in Belleville, where Mayor Michael Melham is looking to expand his council majority. In Irvington, one of two towns in the state with council and school board races, turnout is at 13% so far. A relatively non-competitive race for the Newark Board of Education has a light turnout, with just 5% of ballots already in.

      "NJ-11 race just 5th time in N.J. history where two women ran for Congress - New Jersey Globe New Jersey Globe Navigate X Homepage Congress David Wildstein 3 days ago Categories: CampaignsCongressHighlight NJ-11 race just 5th time in N.J. history where two women ran for Congress Sherrill, Becchi agree on this: both said nation would be better served in women outnumbered men in House, Senate Lillian Egolf, right, the 1962 Democratic candidate for Congress in a Union County district, with New Jersey First Lady (and future Congresswoman ) Helen S. Meyner, in a 1960 photo. (Photo: March of Dimes.) One takeaway from the race between Mikie Sherrill and Rosemary Becchi in New the 11th district: since women won the right to vote in 1920, this is just the 5th time both major parties have nominated a woman to run against each other for the U.S. House of Representatives. In the 650 congressional races in New Jersey since women won the right to vote 100 years ago, two major party women running for Congress happened just four times before Sherrill vs. Becchi. In 2014, Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing) and Republican Alitia Eck faced off in NJ-12. It was the only time in New Jersey where both parties nominated a woman to run for an open seat where no incumbent was seeking re-election. Rep. Marge Roukema (D-Ridgewood), who was the only women representing New Jersey for 20 of her 22 years in Congress, faced a Democratic woman opponent twice: she defeated Rose Brunetto, who had been involved in Demcoratic campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s, in 1984 with 71%; and won 65% against attorney Linda Mercurio in 2000. This first House race between two women came in 1962, when three-term Rep. Florence Dwyer (R-Elizabeth) faced a challenge from Lillian Egolf, the deputy Union County Register of Deeds and Mortgages. Egolf was the widow of former Rahway Mayor James Egolf. Dwyer won 60%-40%. New Jersey has only elected seven women to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and none to the United States Senate. The other three New Jersey congresswomen faced only male opponents: Mary T. Norton (D-Jersey City), who won a Hudson County House seat in 1925 and held it for sixteen years; Millicent Fenwick (R-Bernardsville); and Helen Meyner (D-Phillipsburg). In a debate on Sunday night, Sherrill and Becchi agreed on at least one thing: both said the nation would be better off if women outnumbered men in the House and in teh Senate. The possibility exists that New Jersey might increase the representation of women in their congressional delegation this year from two to three, if Democrat Amy Kennedy unseats Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis) this year. A recent Monmouth University poll has Kennedy running five points ahead of Van Drew. The current New Jersey delegation is 86% male. In total since 1920, New Jersey has elected 111 men and 7 women to Congress (94%-6%). The first woman to win a House seat from New Jersey was Norton, an ally of Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague. She was elected in 1924, the fifth woman to ever serve in Congress. Norton was an ally of Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague; she was the first Democratic State Committeewoman from Hudson County (elected in 1920), the first woman Freeholder in New Jersey (elected 1922), and the first woman to serve as New Jersey Democratic State Chair (elected 1933). She chaired four full House committees during her 26 years in Congress – the longest-serving Congresswoman in New Jersey history. After Norton retired – President Truman hired her as a “Womanpower Consultant” for the U.S. Labor Department’s Defense Manpower task force – New Jersey didn’t have a woman in the delegation until Dwyer, a Republican Assemblywoman from Elizabeth, defeated Rep. Harrison Williams in 1956. Dwyer served sixteen years in Congress before retiring in 1972. Two women were elected to Congress in 1974, back when New Jersey had fifteen districts: Meyner, a former First Lady of New Jersey (her husband was two-term Gov. Robert Meyner) who beat Rep. Joe Maraziti; and Fenwick, a former assemblywoman and state consumer affairs director who won Peter Frelinghuysen’s open seat. Meyner lost her bid for a third term in 1978 and Fenwick left to run for U.S. Senator in 1982. Roukema ousted Rep. Andy Maguire in 1982. Democrats nominated a woman for U.S. Senate in 1932, although it was in a special election to fill the remaining ten weeks of an unexpired term. The party nominated a man for the six-year term. New Jersey has never had a woman U.S. Senator, although the Republicans nominated women in 1982, 1984 and 1990. Republicans elected the first woman governor in 1993; Democrats nominated a woman to run for governor in 2013. New Jersey elected the first two women to the State Assembly in 1921 – about fifteen months after the 19th Amendment was ratified. It took 44 more years to elect a woman to the State Senate. The first woman Assembly Speaker was elected in 1965 – and not again until Sheila Oliver won the post in 2011. It took until 1957 for a black woman to win an Assembly seat, and it wasn’t until 1971 that a black woman was elected to the State Senate. Watson Coleman was the first black woman to be elected to Congress.

Click play for audio version of this story Cory Booker is not expecting to be on the stage when Democratic presidential candidates debate next month, his campaign manager said. “We still see a path to victory for the Democratic nomination that does not include the December debate,” said Addisu Demissie, the Booker manager. “We’re going to keep building brick by brick.” Booker met the Democratic National Committee donor threshold, but failed to reach 4% in national polls or 6% early state contests. Demissie said that Booker will continue to campaign in early states between now and Christmas. “We’ll be in Iowa as much as we can in January,” he said on a conference call with reporters today. He said Booker will go up on TV in Iowa with a $500,000 television and digital buy. Earlier today, Booker received the endorsement of Anderson, South Carolina Mayor Terence Roberts.

      "Pascrell calls on FEC to investigate Trump campaign debts – New Jersey Globe New Jersey Globe Navigate X Homepage Congress Nikita Biryukov 2 days ago Categories: CongressHighlight Pascrell calls on FEC to investigate Trump campaign debts President owes more than $1 million for rally security Rep. Bill Pascrell. Photo by Kevin Sanders for the New Jersey Globe. Click play for audio version of this story Rep. Bill Pascrell called on the Federal Election Commission to investigate President Donald Trump’s campaign over unpaid debts owed to cities where the president has held rallies. Last week, The Washington Post reported Trump owed more than $1.1 million to cities and towns where he has held rallies dating back as far as 2016. Much of the debt is for police overtime. Rallies, especially ones held by a sitting president, require police presence to bolster security. “Donald Trump’s presidential campaign may ignore their obligation to reimburse local officials for the significant assistance provided at these political events,” Pascrell said in a letter to the FEC. “But FEC regulations on reporting disputed debts clearly state that these disputes must be reported until the dispute is resolved.” It’s not clear whether Trump’s campaign is legally liable for the debts in all cases. According to The Post’s report, additional police presence is not typically subject to a contract, though candidates generally recoup host cities for their expense. “As a Co-Chair of the House Law Enforcement Caucus and former Mayor of Paterson, New Jersey, I know local police departments are often cash-strapped and face significant resource deficits,” Pascrell said. “These officers’ service and dedication to keeping our communities safe is invaluable and cannot be understated. It is inappropriate for anyone — foremost the President of the United States — to contend that assistance and protective services provided by local public safety officers at political rallies is not something of value.” Booker headed to Iowa this weekend » « World Series: Houston win could mean a Democratic year in New Jersey, while history says Washington helps GOP Tags: Bill PascrellDonald Trump Nikita Biryukov: Leave a Comment Related Post Rice backs Blackman for Dover mayor NRCC adds Ghassali, Richter to Young Guns list Schirmer: Yaede doesn’t deserve re-election View Non-AMP Version All Rights Reserved\n",

Governor in 2009 Montclair State University President Susan Cole. (Photo: Montclair State University.) Montclair State University President Susan A. Cole will retire in July 2021. Cole has been president of New Jersey’s second-largest state university for 23 years and was the first woman to hold the post. In 2009, Cole was an early contender to become the Democratic nominee for Lt. Governor. Eventually, Gov. Jon Corzine winnowed down his list to two finalists: Loretta Weinberg (D-Teaneck) and Barbara Buono (D-Metuchen), both state senators. Weinberg was offered the post after the indictment of Middlesex County Democratic Chairman Joseph Spicuzzo spooked Corzine. “The people of New Jersey owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Dr. Susan Cole for her extraordinary contributions to our state,” said Gov. Phil Murphy. “She believes deeply in the power of higher education to transform lives and open doors of opportunity. Dr. Cole has been a tireless advocate for the students she serves, and I have great respect and admiration for her and wish her nothing but the best as she embarks on this next chapter.” Spread the news: Republicans slam Murphy over 'baby bonds' proposal » « Dehmer reinstates ousted Piscataway School Board member Tags: Barbara BuonoJon CorzineJoseph SpicuzzoLoretta WeinbergSusan Cole David Wildstein: David Wildstein is the Editor in Chief for the New Jersey Globe.

      "County Clerks to draw for ballots at 3 PM - New Jersey Globe August 15, 2020 Governor Legislature Local Atlantic Bergen Burlington Camden Cape May Cumberland Essex Gloucester Hudson Hunterdon Mercer Middlesex Monmouth Morris Ocean Passaic Salem Somerset Sussex Union Warren National Congress Media Power List Year in Review Voter’s Guide Search for: Home>Campaigns>County Clerks to draw for ballots at 3 PM Employees of the Union County Clerk's Office draw ballot positions for the 2020 primary election in April. Photo: Facebook. County Clerks to draw for ballots at 3 PM By David Wildstein, August 10 2020 1:55 pm Minor political parties have no statutory preference for general election ballot drawings over candidates who simply received enough signatures to gain a place on the November ballot. County Clerks will draw for ballot position at 3 PM today. Most of the clerks have announced that they will broadcast their draws online. Most clerks plan to draw presidential candidates first, although some officials acknowledged that a case could be made for U.S. Senate candidates to be the initial official drawn. New Jersey law requires the highest offices to go first; theoretically, voters are actually casting their ballots for candidates for Elector, not directly for a candidate for president. Democrats and Republicans, the two major political parties in New Jersey, will compete for the top two ballot lines or columns, A and B or 1 and 2. The next drawing will be for the six independent presidential candidates who filed in New Jersey and were certified by Secretary of State Tahesha Way on Sunday: Howie Hawkins (Green Party); Jo Jorgenson (Libertarian Party); Don Blankenship (Constitution Party); Rocky De La Fuente (Alliance Party); Bill Hammons (Unity Party); and Gloria Estela La Riva (Socialism and Liberation). New Jersey recognizes seven minor political parties: Green, Libertarian, Constitution, Socialist, Conservative, Natural Law and Reform. Recognition allows voters to specifically register as members of those parties, but when it comes to ballot drawings there is no difference between a candidate picked by a minor party convention and those who obtain 800 valid signatures on their nominating petitions. Only one minor party candidate filed for the U.S. Senate: Madelyn Hoffman of the Green Party. Hoffman is expected to be bracketed with Hawkins, wherever he winds up on the ballot. Two other independent U.S. Senate candidates filed petitions: Daniel Burke (LaRouche Was Right); and Veronica Fernandez (Of, By, For!). While County Clerks have considerable discretion on ballot design, Burke and Fernandez could wind up on the bottom 9th or 10th columns. The Libertarian Party has candidates for Congress in the 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 10th districts that could be bracketed with Jorgenson. The Green Party filed no House candidates in New Jersey. As of August 1, 78,648 New Jerseyans are registered to one of those seven parties. That includes two parties — Natural Law (7,003) and Reform (1,972) – that have been defunct for sixteen years. The New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission acknowledged in June that a computer glitch has misdirected some voter registration choices to minor parties they never actually chose.
