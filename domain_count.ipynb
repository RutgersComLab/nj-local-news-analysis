In 1997, Lady J invited me, a freshman to play a small role on her radio show, that later ended, but it was just the beginning of my journey in radio. Prior to moving to Buffalo, I most recently served as morning show co-host on WPEG in Charlotte, NC for 5 years. I also spent 2 years as a entertainment report co-host on television station WBTV! I am currently entertaining and informing the Queen City of WNY with the \"2 To 6 Takeover\" weekdays from 2-6 pm on the oldest urban station in the country, The People's Station, 93.7 WBLK!\"\"\",\n",

I started my broadcasting career back in 2015 while attending Rutgers University where I graduated with a double major of Journalism & Media Studies and Theater with a minor in Spanish. I became 94.3 The Point’s Midday Host back in 2017 and since then, I have taken on additional responsibilities including Midday Host of Lite Rock 96.9 WFPG, voicing Townsquare Media’s HOT AC National Weekend Midday Show and now, the host of the nationally-syndicated entertainment show known as Popcrush Nights. You will quickly learn that I have three top obsessions: coffee, wine, and fur babies. I will talk your ears off about my dog, Carolina on the daily and yes, I would label myself as a crazy dog mom. I would also describe myself as creative, bubbly and competitive so even if it is just a game of Uno, watch out. I can’t wait to get to know you and hope that you will take the time to get to know me between 10 AM and 3 PM Monday through Sunday! (Yes, 7 days a week!

Now THAT was a time to be alive! I'm pretty much an open book, so feel free to ask me anything!
